# Diagram
![Diagram](/img/Diagram.png)

A flowchart of the proposed algorithm for segmentation of zones of the lung in CXR of COVID-19 patient. Right (R) and left (L) lung masks are generated by an ensemble method based on the a majority voting from five lung masks predicted by models trained with different conditions. Then, left hilum and carina are detected and used to find a central point to split the whole lung into  upper and lower regions. Finally, right upper lung (RUL), right lower lung (RLL), low upper lung (LUL), and left lower lung (LLL) are obtained.

# Result comparison
![EnsembleResult](/img/EnsembleResult.png)

An example of advantages of the ensemble method for different quality of CXRs. The first to last row in each column shows an input CXR, an ground truth mask, an ensemble result, and five results predicted by the first to fifth model. (a) A clear CXR that shows none of severe noise from a portable device and obstacles like medical devices, (b) a lung mask of (a), (c) an ensemble mask from the first to the fifth masks (d)-(h). Dice coefficients of (c)-(h) are 0.955, 0.928, 0912, 0.948, 0.948, and 0.948, respectively. (i) An CXR showing severe blurry within both lung regions due to lung opacity, (j) a lung mask of (i), (k) an ensemble mask from the first to the fifth masks (l)-(p). Dice coefficients of (k)-(p) are 0.955, 0.928, 0912, 0.948, 0.948, and 0.948, respectively. (q) An CXR showing sever noise generated from a portable device, (r) a lung mask of (q), (s) an ensemble mask from the first to the fifth masks (t)-(x). Dice coefficients of (s)-(x) are 0.899, 0.783, 0.885, 0.883, 0.879, and 0.903, respectively.
